# Project Title

This is a python-based application designed to generate a unique, six-digit One-Time Password (OTP) and deliver it securely to a user’s email. The OTP serves as a verification code for user authentication purposes.

This project is practical for any application requiring an extra layer of security, such as user authentication for web applications, online transactions, or account recovery etc.



## Objective

- Implement a function to generate a secured 6-digit OTP randomly.
- Develop a function to simulate sending the OTP to the user's email address.
- Create a function to prompt the user to enter the OTP received in their email.
- Implement a function to verify the OTP entered by the recipient user.
- Ensure proper error handling and user-friendly prompts.
- Allow the user to retry OTP entry 3 times in case of incorrect input.
